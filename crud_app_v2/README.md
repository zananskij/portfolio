# Task Manager

A full stack Task management tool, built with Node.js, EJS, MongoDB/Mongoose.

Able to view all current/future tasks on main page listed as a table, as well as create/edit/delete new or existing tasks on their own individual page.

Wanted to enable a sorting method for date/priority but that was harded than i thought. Also wanted to create a option to mark tasks as completed and add those to a seperate collection that would be displayed underneath the existing tasks.
