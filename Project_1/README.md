# portfolio

personal repo

Used HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery to build out personal portfolio. Gave each section (Home - About - Projects - Contacts) their own section instead of an individual page.

Started with creating the base HTML layout and adding elements without CSS. Slowly started to incorporate CSS and lastly JS/jQuery features. Looking back I wish I started with the JS/jQuery features first instead of spending so much time on CSS, as those features caused the most issues.

Also I wish i started creating for mobile/tablet first and THEN scaling up to browser, as I really struggled with adjusting / sizing / layout of all the individual elements. Still need to spend more time looking into best practices for sizing + layout for mobile.
